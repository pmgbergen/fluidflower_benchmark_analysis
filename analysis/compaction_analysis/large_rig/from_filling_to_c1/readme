# Structure of the compaction analysis.

1_prepare...:
  correct for curvature etc.

1_star...:
  check how well the corrected images lie over each other.

2_blacken...:
  check whether blackened version of images exists (have to be created with inkscape
  create masks which detect the black region = water (and sealed fault)
  extract labels for the reference image

3_compaction...
  analyze the compaction in a multiscale fashion
  determine the final displacement
  reduce to sparse data - area, centroid displacement, strain analysis

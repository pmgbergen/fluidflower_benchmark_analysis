MAIN IDEA:

The procedure is structured in 3 steps:

  1. Preprocessing.
  2. Segmentation.
  3. Post-analysis.

Each step has its own run script.

  preprocessing.py
  segmentation.py
  postanalysis.py

To obtain the final sparse data results, all three scripts have
to be run subsequently. To ease the process, the overall managing
script performing the full analysis is stored as:

  full_analysis.py
